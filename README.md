# DataCap-Games
My diploma final year project. I developed a kinect exergame in order to demonstrate how Kinect sensor captures data for use of Parkinson's patient rehabilitation.

The features of this game application is:
1. Manage player database.
2. Capture player movements using Kinect software.
3. Save gameplay for medical practitioner and player review.

The game allows Parkinson's patients to monitor their rehabilitation at home while having fun in the process.
The languages used were C# and XAML. The database used was Microsoft Access.
